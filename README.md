## ðŸš€ Future Roadmap

### User Accounts & Progression
- Full authentication system with Google Sign-In and standard email/password.
- Leveling system (Beginner â†’ Expert) where users can "level up" by mastering topics.
- Store all quiz history, answers, and performance statistics for authenticated users.
- Limited experience for anonymous users with pre-cached questions to encourage sign-ups.

### Advanced Quiz Engine & Content
- Hybrid system using local pool of questions for introductory topics and dynamic AI generation for advanced concepts.
- Expand content with more Python topics (decorators, concurrency) and new languages like JavaScript, C++, Go, and Rust.
- Flexible backend supporting multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) and optional user API keys.

### Gamification & Engagement
- Visual learning roadmap or skill tree where users can "unlock" new concepts as they progress.
- Achievements, badges (e.g., "Python Basics Master", "10-Day Streak"), and other gamified elements.

### Enhanced Results & User Profiles
- Detailed analytics, including time taken per question.
- Export quiz results to Markdown or PDF for offline review.
- Comprehensive user profile page with performance graphs (accuracy over time, topic mastery) and a GitHub-style activity chart.
